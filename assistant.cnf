# Start Replica Assistant client configuration file
# created by Edward Stoever for MariaDB Support

# Use this file to specify any standard client options 
# If none are specified, the script will attempt a socket connection from 
# unix account, such as root@localhost.

# In almost all cases, it is best to run the Start Replica Assistant as root@localhost.

# The group name must be [start_replica_assistant]
[start_replica_assistant]
